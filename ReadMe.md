>-    In building this recommendation, we started with a PowerPoint presentation which outlined the approach which we will be taking.
>-    The client has agreed on a 3 week scope with the following 3 phases as follows - Data Exploration; Model Development and Interpretation.
>-    Prepared a detailed approach for completing the analysis including activities – i.e. understanding the data distributions, feature engineering, data transformations, modelling, results interpretation and reporting.


># Task 3: Data Insights and Presentation<br>

>-    What are the trends in the underlying data?
>-    Which customer segment has the highest customer value?
>-    What do you propose should be Sprocket Central Pty Ltd ’s marketing and growth strategy?
